Dear Gentle Reader,

Herein you will find an example that you can use to typset your own thesis manuscript. Although the example attempts to be complete and correct, you are well advised to consult the CSUF Thesis Manual and heed the advice of  the University Thesis/Dissertation Reader, Debra Stewart.

All the information you need can be found at the CSUF Graduate Studies website, more specifically <http://fullerton.edu/graduate/currentstudents/thesis.asp>.

The likelihood is high that you or your local LaTeX guru will need to make modifications to the CSUF Thesis class, <csufthesis.cls>. Please submit a patch or a pull request on GitHub.

Sincerely,

Michael Shafae
